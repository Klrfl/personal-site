# About me

Hello, my name is {myName}. I am a student and tech enthusiast from
Indonesia currently learning web development. I have {
  new Date().getFullYear() - 2021
} years of experience using various web technologies to craft beautiful
clean and maintainable websites.
    

When it comes to tools, I am flexible to learning whatever is needed to
get the job done. Throughout my career so far in the web development
space, I have made various things with several technologies, including:
    
<ul>
  {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
</ul>


In my development, I use Neovim on WSL2 for both work and play. You can
check out my config on [Github](https://github.com/klrfl/nvim-config).

when I'm not coding, I like reading about tech, editing Indonesian
Wikipedia articles about Formula One, playing guitar, or playing chess.

I first got into software development when I was in 9th grade. At the time
I was looking at Python tutorial videos on YouTube, and out of curiosity I
[clicked one of them](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc) and learned Python. I
remember when I first installed Python and Pycharm, then printing hello
world to the console. I was so happy that I can program a computer to do
something. From there, my curiosity peaked. I looked into web development,
learned HTML CSS and JS, and now here we are. Huge thanks to Mosh for
getting me to where I am now!
