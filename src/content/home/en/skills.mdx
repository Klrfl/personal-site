  ## Skills

  In the last three years, I have learned and used many different
  technologies in the frontend world. I am proficient in <TechChip>
    HTML
  </TechChip>, <TechChip>CSS</TechChip>, and <TechChip>
    JavaScript
  </TechChip>, and have experience using
  <TechChip href="https://astro.build"> Astro </TechChip>,
  <TechChip href="https://vuejs.org">Vue</TechChip> and more
  recently <TechChip href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</TechChip>
   and <TechChip href="https://react.dev">React</TechChip>. Outside of web
  development, I have experience writing <TechChip>Lua</TechChip> in Roblox
  Studio, and I also learned a little bit of <TechChip>Python</TechChip> and
  <TechChip>C</TechChip>.
  

  Even though my learning experience is primarily on the frontend side, I have
  experience in fullstack PAASes such as <TechChip
  href="https://firebase.google.com/"> Firebase </TechChip> and <TechChip
  href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</TechChip>, and even backend
  technologies such as <TechChip href="https://go.dev"> Go </TechChip> and
  <TechChip href="https://postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</TechChip>.
