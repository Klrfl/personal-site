  ## Projects

  I strongly believe in learning by doing to acquire new skills
  effectively. So, when I learn a new technology, I always do projects,
  be it large or small. Here are some of them.

  <ul class="projects-container odd-columns">
    {
      projects
        .sort((a, b) => a.data.order - b.data.order)
        .map(({data}) => <ProjectCard project={data} />)
    }
  </ul>
</section>
