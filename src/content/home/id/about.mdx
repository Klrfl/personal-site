  ## Tentang saya

  {/* TODO: update */}
  My name is Efraim Munthe, I am a student currently learning about
  front-end web development and the JAMStack. I also recently got into
  backend web development, dabbling in NodeJS, PostgreSQL and Express. I
  haven't learned much about them, so I haven't put them into my skills
  yet.

    <CTA href={getRelativeLocaleUrl(locale, "about")} primary margin>Baca lebih lanjut</CTA>
